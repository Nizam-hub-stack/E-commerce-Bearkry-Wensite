<p><strong>Basic Concept of the Project:</strong> The Bakery Shop Management System is designed to replace the traditional manual way of managing a bakery shop with a digital platform. It aims to streamline operations such as order management, inventory tracking, and customer interactions. By using this system, bakery staff can efficiently manage their products, track inventory, process orders, and interact with customers in a more organized way. The system is user-friendly and helps in eliminating errors associated with manual processes. Additionally, it supports remote access, allowing bakery owners and staff to manage operations from anywhere.</p>

<p>The key objective of this system is to simplify the workflow of a bakery shop by offering a centralized platform where all important processes like product management, customer orders, and stock levels can be monitored and handled efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Modules in the Project:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Customer Management Module:</strong> This module allows the bakery to manage its customers. It stores customer details, tracks their order history, and helps in providing personalized services. Customers can also create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.</p>

<p><strong>2. Product Management Module:</strong> This module manages the bakery's product catalog. It allows the bakery to add new products, update existing product details, and categorize items (e.g., cakes, bread, snacks). It also helps in keeping product information updated for customers.</p>

<p><strong>3. Order Management Module:</strong> This module is used to handle customer orders. It allows customers to select products, add them to the cart, review their orders, and make payments. The bakery staff can track order statuses and manage deliveries or pickups accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>4. Inventory Management Module:</strong> The inventory module helps the bakery keep track of product stock levels. It automatically updates inventory as sales occur and can notify the staff when stock levels are low, helping in inventory control and restocking.</p>

<p><strong>5. Authentication Module:</strong> This module ensures secure access to the system by allowing customers to register, log in, and access their personalized accounts. It also provides user role management for customers and staff, ensuring different levels of access.</p>

<p><strong>6. Cart Management Module:</strong> This module allows customers to add products to their cart while browsing the bakery's catalog. They can review, update, or remove items from the cart before proceeding to checkout.</p>

<p><strong>7. Payment Processing Module:</strong> This module handles the payment process. It allows customers to complete their purchases securely using various payment options and generates receipts for the transactions.</p>

<p><strong>8. Reporting Module:</strong> This module generates reports for the bakery staff, such as sales reports, inventory reports, and customer order history. These reports help in analyzing the bakeryâ€™s performance and making informed decisions.</p>

<p><strong>9. Search and Filter Module:</strong> This module allows customers to search for specific bakery products and filter results based on categories like price, product type, or availability. This helps customers find their desired items more quickly.</p>
